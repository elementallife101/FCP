	- --network <size(Type:int)>
		This argument generates a random network of the specified size. It then calculates and returns the mean degree, the mean clustering coefficient and mean path length of the 		randomly generated network.
	- --test_network 
		This argument runs through the test assertions which were provided within the specification to ensure that the module is completing the intended operation.
	- --analysis
		This argument is designed to help users visualise the data structures and formats present within the code. When called, it returns each node and the connections it has for 		a random network of size 10.
